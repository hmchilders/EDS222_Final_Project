Impact of Land Use Change on Water Storage in the Yolo County Area

After high school, I knew I wanted to leave Santa Barbara and gain some independence in a new town. When applying to colleges I fell in love with the small town of Davis, California. While at UC Davis, I got my undergraduate degree in Biological and Agricultural Engineering. One of the things I enjoyed about studying agriculture is how interdisciplinary the field is, within agriculture you can specialize in genetic engineering, biology, chemistry, climate, sustainability, etc.

As populations continue to grow, pressure for the agricultural industry to keep up with increasing food demands while reducing resource consumption grows with it. Since Davis is typically known to the students as "Ag Town", I thought it would be interesting to see how the land usage of cultivated crops has changed over time. Similarly, I hypothesized that there would be a negative correlation between area of cultivated crop land, and water storage.
